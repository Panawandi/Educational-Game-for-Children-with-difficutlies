In my bachelor's thesis, I designed and developed a Java application tailored for children.
The application comprised three mini-games, including a language/alphabet game and an animal game.
It featured adaptive difficulty levels that adjusted according to the children's ages.
The development was carried out using Java for the application logic and MySQL for database management.
